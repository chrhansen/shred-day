# Project Brief

*   **Structure:** Monorepo with React frontend (`/client`) and Rails API backend (`/server`). Deployment via Kamal.
*   **Core Requirements:**
    *   User accounts with email/password sign-up and sign-in (using Rails sessions).
    *   Log ski days with details (date, resort, skis, etc.), associated with the logged-in user.
    *   View logged ski days (user-specific) on a calendar.
    *   View logged ski days (user-specific) on a map.
    *   Filter the user's ski days by equipment, people, etc.
    *   Backend API for data storage and retrieval, with endpoints protected by session authentication.
    *   Display user-specific statistics (total days, unique resorts, etc.).
*   **Goals:** Create an app for skiers to easily log and review their *own* skiing activities visually (calendar, map) and through filtered lists.

# Project Intelligence & Developer Notes

This document is a living journal for the "Shred Day" project. It's intended to capture key insights, patterns, preferences, and project-specific intelligence that helps the AI assistant (and human developers) work more effectively.

## Key Sections to Consider:

### 1. Critical Implementation Paths & Decisions
*   *Example: Why was a specific library chosen over another?*
*   *Example: Rationale behind a core architectural decision.*
*   ...

### 2. User Preferences & Workflow
*   *Example: Specific coding style preferences not covered by linters.*
*   *Example: Preferred ways of being asked for clarification.*
*   *Example: Common commands or scripts frequently used.*
*   ...

### 3. Project-Specific Patterns
*   *Example: How are state management patterns typically handled in the React app?*
*   *Example: Common data validation patterns in the Rails API.*
*   *Example: Naming conventions for specific types of components or services.*
*   ...

### 4. Known Challenges & Workarounds
*   *Example: Any tricky integrations or flaky dependencies and how they are managed.*
*   *Example: Performance bottlenecks discovered and potential solutions/mitigations.*
*   ...

### 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
*   *Brief notes on why a certain approach was changed or refactored.*
*   ...

### 6. Tool Usage & Configuration Notes
*   *Specifics about how certain dev tools are configured or used in this project if not obvious.*
*   *Notes on CI/CD pipeline quirks or important steps.*
*   ...

### 7. Important Environment Variables or Setup Notes
*   *Beyond the standard setup, are there any special environment variables or configuration steps needed for specific features?*
*   *e.g., `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` for OAuth, and where they are used.*
*   ...

*Remember: The goal is to capture valuable insights that aren't immediately obvious from the code itself, making it easier to onboard new developers or for the AI to assist effectively after a context reset.*
